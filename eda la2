help()-Brings up a help entry for the specified command help.start()-Opens the help system in the browser
apropos()-shows all the commands that contain the “partword” install.packages(“pkg”)-Installs a library of commands from the CRAN website install.packages()-Shows a list of packages that are installed.
library(pkg)-Loads a package of commands,making them available for use search()-Shows a list of packages that are available and loaded for use example()-View some examples on the use of a command
ls()-Lists memory of contents

ls.str(pattern=‘data’)-This lists all the objects with “data” in their name and shows you the structure of each. ls(pattern=‘b’)-Here the pattern looks for everything containing a “b”
ls(pattern=“^be”)-If you want to search for objects beginning with a certain letter you use the ^ character

ls(pattern=‘1’)-letters are enclosed in square brackets the square brackets is to isolate the letters; each is treated as a separate item, hence objects beginning with “b” or “e” are matched
ls(pattern=‘m$’)-To find objects ending with a specific character you use a dollar sign at the end ls(pattern=‘a.e’)-You can use the period as a wildcard and R will match any character
class()-You can obtain information about the type of object

sort()-The sort() function is used to sort the elements of a vector or a data frame in ascending order. It returns a new vector or data frame with the elements arranged in ascending order.
rank()-The rank() function computes the ranks of the elements in a vector. It assigns a unique rank to each element based on its value, where the smallest element receives a rank of 1.
method(): The method() function is not a built-in R function. The term “method” typically refers to a specific implementation or algorithm for solving a problem in R.
row.names()-function in R is used to retrieve or set the row names of a matrix or a data frame. history()-You can view the current list of the history items
savehistory(file=‘.Rhistory’)-You can save the current history to a desk loadhistory(file=‘.Rhistory’)-You can load the file from the history c(),scan()-Enter data manually to a vector in R
rep()-Make Vector of repeated values seq()-Make arithmetic progression vector
View()-View dataset in a spreadsheet-type format data()-Load built-in dataset
dim()-See dimensions(rows/columns)of a dataframe str()-Display internal structure of an R-object
read.csv(),read.table()-load into data frame an existing datafile require()-Make available an R add-oon package
names()-List names of variables in a data frame length()-Give length of a vector
rm()-removes an item from memory
